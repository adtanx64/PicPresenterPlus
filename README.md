# Introduction
Just a little project I'm making.. An extension of the Picture Viewer Tutorial available on [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd492135.aspx). Added features include Dual Screen View.
EDIT 2023: This project has been in the backburner for years, yet the vision still remains. Hopefully we can continue working on this once we're better off.

# What I've Done So Far
- Dual Screen View on another form.
- Memory management optimizations.

# Where to next
- We will make a playlist of pictures, drag and drop...  Add video functionality... The possibilities are endless.
- Graphics, styled text (outline, shadow, gradient fill, glow, 3D, etc...)
- Gapless audio, seamless playback...
- Eventually, I plan to make this program into a fully-fledged broadcast-grade multimedia presentation software for use in the home, church, and school. The workplace and businesses has had too much of their technology love, so we're catering a prosumer market.
